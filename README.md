Postify is a social media platform inspired by Facebook, built with React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Firebase.
It features a dynamic home feed with pagination, likes, shares, and a multi-level nested comments system,
allowing users to comment, reply, and reply-to-replies with real-time updates.
The platform includes signup/login/logout/password reset & Google login, user profiles with posts and likes
stats, and an integrated real-time chat system based on “Zajel”, similar to Facebook Messenger.
